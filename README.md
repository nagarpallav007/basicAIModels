some python algorithms to understand DL, neural network and its functioning
The above example is a basic implementation of a neural network using only NumPy in Python. 
It is a binary classifier that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan or not. 
The neural network has three input features: income, age, and loan amount.

This code takes user input for the candidate's age, income, student status, and credit rating, and uses the trained model to make a prediction
on whether to give a loan to the candidate or not. 
If the prediction result is greater than or equal to 0.5, it prints "Loan eligible", otherwise it prints "Loan not eligible".
